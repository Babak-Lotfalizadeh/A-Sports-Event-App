# Sports Event

a Flutter application that displays sports events based on the provided local data.

## EVENTS
I am loading the Event from asset text file and  convert that as JSON to vide model and use that.
### Description
I add extra field Description for details page (looks like we need that base on Figma)
### End Time
I add extra field name as end time (looks like we need that base on Figma)
### Image
I am loading image base on model ur and load the provided image as fallback image.
### Mouse hove
in design there was a hover color for item, we don't have that in mobile (when we have no mouse), so I add that design as Click animation as well


## Sizes
I try to be use perfect pixel design from Figma, there are some problem with that design, I only mention those on the code with Todo keyword.
in real case we need to fix that with help of UI team.
